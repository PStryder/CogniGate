# CogniGate
CogniGate is a leased cognitive execution worker.  It performs bounded, tool-mediated AI cognition on behalf of other systems, materializes durable artifacts, and reports lifecycle state through receipts.  CogniGate does not think for itself. It executes cognition under lease, with explicit constraints, explicit tools, and explicit outputs.
